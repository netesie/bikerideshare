Finding my actionable metrics is the fun part that comes from exploring the dataset.\n\nInitially, there were many null values in the start and end location columns so I decided not to focus on metrics based on those fields, early on . The consistent fields were ride_id, the type of bicycle used for each trip, Start and end times of each trip ,start and end latitude/longitude coordinates, and what type of member the rider was ( casual or annual).\n\nSo in Excel I decided to start off finding each trips 'ride_length' by subtracting the end ride time by the start ride time.\n\nNext, I decided to single out the day of the week from each ride id's start time in order to get a feel on how rides were going in a Work Week/End format. Using the WEEKDAY function I was able to do that,starting my week on Sunday. I named the column 'day_of_week'\n```\n=WEEKDAY(C2,1)\n```\nNext I singled out the time of day in hours(AM/PM) because I was hoping to find out if rush hour effects casual riders differently than annual members. Singling out the time of day in its own column will make it easier to group data this way down the line. I named this column 'hour_of_day'.\n\n```\n=TIME(HOUR(D2),0,0)\n```\n\nI quickly put my cleaned data into a pivot table format to see if these newly created fields would be able to do the job and give me some preliminary insights on a monthly level. \nAfter doing this for each of the 12 datasets I should be ready to export these cleaned tables into a Google BigQuery. There I will combine the 12 tables  into a single year partitioned table ...then spatial join it to a shapefile of Chicagos Community Areas ...so I can see how certain data points in certain neighborhoods trend over time.\n\nI downloaded Chicagos community area data from this website:\n[Boundaries Community

It seemed only casual riders were using these bikes, in addition to the other 2. Strangely enough some of the trip duration lengths lasted multiple days and had null values for their end of ride gps location (lat/long).\n\nAfter further investigation into these, long duration and no end gps location rides... I found multiple articles of bike share theft in the Chicago area where this dataset represents. So for now we will filter out data that seems to look like a stolen bike  (has no end of ride gps and the trip duration is over 24 hours). I want to focus on converting the casual riders that aren't stealing bikes lol.\n\n##### 3.1 Metrics\nAfter looking and living with the data I decided to focus on the metrics of: \n\n**_1.

Which days of the week and time of day show the most rides for each group (casual/member)._**\n\n**_3. Finally, the Top 3 most used bike station locations for each group._** \n\nI always find that focusing on the trend or rate of data is more important than static numbers (unless its a big company goal to reach a certain static number). Focusing on time segments that are appropriate to the scale of the problem, keeps decison makers looking to improve or take action.
